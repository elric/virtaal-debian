This provides an OSX theme for GTK that will emulate the look of Leopard
(OSX 10.5). It doesn't use native colours, but should integrate well with the
default theme of Leopard. It was obtained here:

In reality it only mimicks the default theme, and will therefore work on Linux
as well.

A native theme for Aqua is advertised here:

This should query Aqua for the real colours used by the user, but is said to not
be very stable yet. It might be worthwhile to investigate at some stage.
