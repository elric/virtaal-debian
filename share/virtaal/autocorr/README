These files provide the data used for the automatic correction in Virtaal. They
are mostly used verbatim from OpenOffice.org.

You can usually find them in an OpenOffice.org installation in something like
basis3.1/share/autocorr/

or in the OpenOffice.org source tree in something like
extras/source/autotext/lang

We might want to look for newer ones from time to time somewhere such as
http://hg.services.openoffice.org/
